Have your machine learning models trained but got bored of it running only on your screen? Edge ML is here to utilise edge devices from smartphones to micro-controllers, to process data and run algorithms locally, bringing AI from the cloud to your fingertips. Join us to learn more about this piece of revolutionary technology and deploy your ML models to solve unique problems!

This workshop is part of the Deep Learning Week series. Aims to introduce machine learning at the edge and consists of some hands on sessions.
