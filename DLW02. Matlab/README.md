# Introduction to MatLab: A new Solution to Deep Learning
<hr>

## Intro to MATLAB
<br>

<p>MATLAB is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists. The heart of MATLAB is the MATLAB language, which is a matrix-based language allowing the most natural expression of computational mathematics.<p>

<p>MATLAB takes your ideas from research to production.<p>
 
1st part covers:
**<p>1. Working environment introduction<p>**
 **<p>2. Basic Syntax<p>**
**<p>3. Random Walk (RW) Problem<p>**
**<p>4. Monte-Carlo Simulation with Blackjack<p>**

## Deep Learning Labelling
<br>

<p>MATLAB is an excellent tool to assist in the visualisation aspect of deep learning and can work in conjunction with other tools like Python to create effective deep learning models that are not limited to computer vision.<p>
 
<p>Remember to run the code with the correct files in your current folder in MATLAB else errors may arise.
 
**Evaluation Data** should be placed in Part 2 of the codes folder.<p>
<p>The PDF file contains additional links that may interest you.<p>
