# Computer Vision Dataset Conversion Scripts
Scripts for converting to and from common dataset formats for object detection and instance segmentation
* COCO2VOC
* VOC2COCO
* COCO2LabelMe
* LabelMe2COCO

## Common Annotation Tools
* [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) - Lightweight tool used for instance segmentation annotation
* [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) - Lightweight tool used for object detection annotation
* [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat) - Requires substantial installtion, but very robust and can be used for annotation of almost all computer vision tasks, both image and video. Also supports automated annotation. Once annotated, can be exported in various formats.
