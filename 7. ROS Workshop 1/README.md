# ROS Workshop 1: Introduction

This workshop uses [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/), an online platform for learning ROS. The ROSject (project inside The Construct) for this workshop has been prepared. No local installation of ROS is therefore required.  

Please refer to the presentation slide and YouTube recording of the workshop for details on using the prepared ROSject.
